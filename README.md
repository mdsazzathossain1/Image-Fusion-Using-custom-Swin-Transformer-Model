# Image-Fusion-Using-custom-Swin-Transformer-Model
Trains/evaluates a PyTorch model to fuse infrared and visible images using a custom encoderâ€“decoder with transformer-style fusion blocks (Swin/ViT-like attention). Evaluates fused outputs with SSIM and PSNR; includes a dataset class that loads paired IR/Visible images.
